  "summary": "Diff implements an auth bootstrapping UX with an explicit initializing/loading state on the Auth screen, automatic navigation to /chats when an existing identity is present, and a sessionStorage-based “skip auto-login” marker set on sign-out to prevent immediate re-entry until the user explicitly signs in again.",

    {
      "description": "Added initializing/loading state gating on non-Auth screens (ChatList, ChatThread, Settings) to show spinners and suppress redirects while auth is initializing.",
      "reason": "REQ-20 only specifies preventing Auth-screen flicker during initialization; it does not require adding initialization loading UI to other screens.",
